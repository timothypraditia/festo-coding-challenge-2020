    "To make up for his poor salary at THE EVIL COMPANY, the system admin works for a food delivery service on the way home. His job is to pick up meals from the five restaurants (r1,...,r5) in any order and bring them to the corresponding customers (c1,...,c5). After picking up one meal, he does not have to drive to the customer immediately. He can also pick up multiple meals first and then deliver them. The only constraint is that, on his bike, he can only carry three meals max. Travel times:\n",
